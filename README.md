A Software enthusiast and a big Programing fan. I am currently learning more and more about Computer💻 Architectures and Systems, I am an Open-Source lover and I really ❤ researched based projects.
In these days I mainly use C and Assembly for most of the low level stuff other than that I use JavaScript, Python and Java for most of my Programs. 
I am good at making websites and Mobile Apps.

### What I do 👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻 ?

<p>I am a CSE Undergrad, Currently I am studying and learning mainly about Computer Architectures and Working of computer Systems. 
It was always my passion to being in the machine to instruct the hardware on the lowest layer of compilation. 
Other than that I love to make Websites and Mobile Applications too but for fun.
