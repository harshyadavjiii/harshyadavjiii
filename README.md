<p>
  I am an aspiring AI and Machine Learning expert with a passion for mathematics, programming, and data-driven problem-solving. 
  For me, code is more than syntax. it’s a way of thinking, a bridge between logic and imagination. Math fuels my curiosity, 
  shaping how I approach patterns, algorithms, and real-world challenges. 
  I dream of building systems that not only learn and adapt but also create meaningful impact.

### What I do 👨‍💻👨‍💻👨‍💻 ?

<p>
  Every project I take on is a step toward merging mathematics, code, and 
  creativity into solutions that inspire change and push the boundaries of what’s possible in AI and data science.
